# Programming for Data Analytics: Weather Analysis

This repository contains resources for relating to the Programming for Data Analytics module at the Atlantic Technical University. It contains results from the labs, assessments, course ware and the final project. The final project brings together the skills of creating a database, importing data files from urls, creating dataframes and analysing the data.

   git clone https://github.com/kknb1982/pfda
   cd pfda
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**
Create and activate a virtual environment using Anaconda:
```conda create --name weather_analysis python=3.9
conda activate weather_analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
Open the notebook using Visual Studio Code:
- Open Visual Studio Code and navigate to the cloned repository.
- Install the "Python" and "Jupyter" extensions if prompted.
- Launch the notebook by opening ``weather_suitability.ipynb` and running the cells.

Or run from the command line with:
```jupyter notebook```
Then navigate to `weather_suitability.ipynb`.

### Running the notebook in GitHub Codespaces
1. Open the Repository in Codespaces
- Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
